title: "What to Know Before Getting Started"

## My Process

I use a combination of software and outboard hardware processing on individual tracks as well as the 2-track stereo mix. All mixdowns pass through either of my [16-channel analog mixers](/gear/#mixers) for tone color and analog/tube characteristics. On projects with a high (more than 16) track count, I sum tracks to stereo stems "in the box" before routing them out to the analog world. The mix is routed through a subtle outboard 2-track mix compression for some "glue", but I generally don't apply any "brick wall" limiting to mixes.

I will integrate reverb, delay, and other effects from my own sources into mixes to suit the style we agree upon. If you don't like them just let me know, I promise it will not hurt my feelings.

### Revisions

The initial version I send to you will be a result of my intuition, any written direction you've provided for the track, any reference tracks you have provided, and any cleanup or utility editing that I do. From here you review the mix and send me notes on what you want changed. If we're doing a batch of songs it's generally more efficient to collect thoughts on all tracks and send them all over at once. Often I'll pick a song to start with and send over an initial version before moving on to other songs just to make sure I'm on the right track.

DAW sessions and plugin settings are saved and extensive outboard notes are taken for maximum recallability, so we can always iterate on a mix version until we arrive at a final result we're both happy with. Please keep in mind that recalling sessions and printing new mixes takes more time than just opening a file and hitting "bounce". I don't put a hard limit on number of revisions we go through to get to the final product, but I reserve the right to start charging hourly if the target keeps moving.

## Preparing Files for Mixing

You'll want to send over the highest quality audio files that you have. All files should:

- contain audio that starts from the _same starting point_: usually the beginning of your session. If you send a region of audio that starts halfway through the song, I won't know where to place it in the session.
- contain audio scoped to a specific sound. Don't put a guitar and a french horn on the same audio track. Conversely, if you have comp'd four guitar tracks down to one guitar part, please consolidate them into one track.
- be named something sensible. A helpful filename has the name of the instrument and a description of its utility in the song. This will help me group things together quicker.
- only contain effects that are _essential_ to the track itself. I generally recommend against including reverb on individual tracks unless it's the only track that has that reverb, or it's an effect that can't be recreated on my end. When in doubt, make uneffected and effected versions of the track and notate that in the track name.
- not take DAW session volume into account. I want the loudest possible signal, so if possible, don't bounce a track at a reduced volume from your session.

Create a folder for each song containing all of its individual tracks and get that to me somehow. I don't have a preference on file-sharing services but I use Google Drive to send you mixes. If needed, I can provide you a Google Drive folder to upload your audio files to.

**Please double-check your files** before sending them over. The process of creating audio files for each track in your session can be done in many different ways and can sometimes yield unexpected results. If you're unsure what to do we can talk through it. Generally I want raw audio files that don't have effects or gain/volume adjustments saved to them.

After creating your files, try opening a new session in your DAW, dumping them all in, and playing the track back. Everything should line up in time. Sending over forgotten or edited tracks after we've started the mixing process can really slow things down.

I do not accept DAW session files for mixing. Unfortunately there's just too much variation with versions, licensing, plugins, and system requirements for this to make sense.

## The Finished Product

I will keep a Google Drive folder accessible to you with _all_ versions of every mix. Each file will be a stereo AIFF file (unless you request WAVs) at the highest quality possible: I will not downsample or reduce the bitrate unless you request it. This means if you send me 24bit/96kHz audio files, I'll send you 24bit/96kHz mix files. Sample rate or bit depth conversion is best done in the mastering process based on your intended medium(s).

I don't guarantee that the Google Drive folder with your mixes will be available forever, so please download everything from the folder and copy it to your own storage for archival purposes (read: the inevitable hit documentary that will be made about your band in 20 years).

I do not provide mastering services, which can be thought of as the final steps to get your music ready for distribution. This means I don't do any "brick wall" limiting, track sequencing, or cue sheet generation. I recommend [Eureka Mastering](https://eurekamastering.com/) for all of your mastering needs.
