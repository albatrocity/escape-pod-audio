A great mix should enhance the feel of a song and transport the listener to other places. Creating space in the sonic spectrum for each instrument to serve its intended purpose is paramount to a deep, three-dimensional sound. If you're looking for impactful and memorable presentations of your recorded material, I'd love to work with you at competitive rates. Please <a href="mailto:albatrocity@gmail.com?subject=Mix%20Me!">get in touch with me</a> and we can work something out. I promise I'm not as stuffy as this website might make me seem.
